Initialzie 5 separate integer number N1,N2,N3,N4,N5 =0
Initialzie integer Average A = 0
Input 5 separate integer number N1,N2,N3,N4, N5
Read  5 separate integer number N1,N2,N3,N4, N5 was inputed
Do calculate the average of the five number A = (N1+N2+N3+N4+N5)/5
Prinout: " Average of five numbers  (N1+N2+N3+N4+N5)/5 = A "
Go to next step
Find the smallest number of the five number
Check N1 If N1 is smallest
Printout "N1 is smallest"
Else check N2
If N2 is smallest
Printput "N2 is smallest"
Else check N3 
If N3 is smallest
Printout: "N3 is smllest"
Else check N4 
If N4 is smallest
Printout: "N4 is smallest"
Eles N5 is smallest
Printout : "N5 is smallest"
Go to next step
Find the biggest number of the five number
Check N1 If N1 is biggest
Printout "N1 is biggest"
Else check N2
If N2 is biggest
Printput "N2 is biggest"
Else check N3 
If N3 is biggest
Printout: "N3 is biggest"
Else check N4 
If N4 is biggest
Printout: "N4 is biggest"
Eles N5 is biggest
Printout : "N5 is biggest"
